      goal: Enter the maelstrom portal
      description: |
          You enter a opening in the forest where a group clad in the wear of the
          local loyalists is gathered around
          a maelstorm portal.  The whole area is swarming with the effects
          of the maelstrom. The portal is the first you've seen in days and
          you can't miss this opportunity to escape this realm.
      question: Do you chose to?

                Pretend you too are loyalists and in the confusion, rush to enter the portal.

                Wait in hiding, spying on the group to see if an opportunity opens up where
                you can enter the portal.
            check: each stealth * 50% && 80% chance

                Surprise the loyalists and try to disable them from stopping you from entering
                the portal.
