      has been seen in the area: persistent and large. A band of adventurers is
      gathering in the town to scale the mountain-side and investigate. They
      seem fools for none of them are among the immune. Logan, Kestrel, and
      Isabel must decide whether to accompany the group - perhaps to learn
      something themselves or perhaps to lessen the chance of the group all
      dying out there."

      help this woman, who does not seem to know she is now in a different
      reality.
